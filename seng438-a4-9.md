# Introduction

In the fourth assignment for SENG 438, we look at two different types of testing approaches.

The first type is known as mutation testing. This is known as fault-based testing, and is done by injecting mutants into our system and checking to see if our test suite is strong enough to kill these mutants, or if they still persist. This was done on our test suites that we have been working on from assignment 1 all the way through assignment 3 for the JFreeChart class.

The second type is known as web-based testing, which tends to be done by automatic tools like Selenium. In this assignment, web-based testing is done by recording tests on specific websites that all have similar functionalities, and then replaying those tests again to see if they will execute with no defects.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

## Maheen:

In order to create and execute tests on the website "ebay", I first just thought of basic scenarios customers might go through when accessing the site. 

## First test case design:

The first test case I thought of was testing the search functionality of the website. As someone that has used ebay and other online shopping websites before, the first thing customers tend to do is search for an item, without even logging in. So my first test case design consisted for the following steps:
 1. Access the ebay website
 2. Search for a specific item
 3. Wait for it to appear
 4. Click on an option

 ## Second test case design:

The second case design was to test the "add-to-cart" functionality that most online shopping sites tend to have. This test case directly connects to the first one, as customers will search for an item, select the item of their choosing, and then add the item to their cart. The second test case design consisted of the following steps:
1. Access the ebay website
2. Search for a specific item
3. Wait for it to appear
4. Click on an option
5. Select appropriate sizes/options
6. Click on the "add-to-cart" button
7. Click on the "cart" button in the top right corner
8. Double check cart with selected items

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
