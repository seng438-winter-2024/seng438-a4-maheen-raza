# Introduction

In the fourth assignment for SENG 438, we look at two different types of testing approaches.

The first type is known as mutation testing. This is known as fault-based testing, and is done by injecting mutants into our system and checking to see if our test suite is strong enough to kill these mutants, or if they still persist. This was done on our test suites that we have been working on from assignment 1 all the way through assignment 3 for the JFreeChart class.

The second type is known as web-based testing, which tends to be done by automatic tools like Selenium. In this assignment, web-based testing is done by recording tests on specific websites that all have similar functionalities, and then replaying those tests again to see if they will execute with no defects.

### Mutation Coverage and Statistics After Writing New Tests:

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

## For DataUtilites

Looking at the test suite that was made for assignment 3, in terms of statement, method and branch coverage, the test suite did a good job in terms of overall coverage for all three. When I ran the PIT on the DataUtilities test suite, the initial, starting mutation coverage, before adding any new test cases, was already pretty high, starting at 88%. This, to me, indicates that the initial test suite developed from assignment 3 was effective in catching injected mutants into our SUT.

## Maheen:

In order to create and execute tests on the website "ebay", I first just thought of basic scenarios customers might go through when accessing the site. 

## First test case design:

The first test case I thought of was testing the search functionality of the website. As someone that has used ebay and other online shopping websites before, the first thing customers tend to do is search for an item, without even logging in. So my first test case design consisted for the following steps:
 1. Access the ebay website
 2. Search for a specific item
 3. Wait for it to appear
 4. Click on an option

 ## Second test case design:

The second case design was to test the "add-to-cart" functionality that most online shopping sites tend to have. This test case directly connects to the first one, as customers will search for an item, select the item of their choosing, and then add the item to their cart. The second test case design consisted of the following steps:
1. Access the ebay website
2. Search for a specific item
3. Wait for it to appear
4. Click on an option
5. Select appropriate sizes/options
6. Click on the "add-to-cart" button
7. Click on the "cart" button in the top right corner
8. Double check cart with selected items

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

When using Selenium to run tests for web-based applications, the use of the checkpoints are quite helpful in order to figure out which interactions with the web application the testing tools fails or struggles to capture. It also helps decipher the steps in order to perform specific tests, and if there are any defects or issues with the test case.

When using checkpoints, I did find some defects when executing the basic add-to-cart functionality, where it would abort after adding the item to the cart, but won't click on the cart to show what items are inside.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

## Maheen:

In order to test the two functionalities with different test data, I thought of common situations that customers might find themselves in when either using the search functionality or when adding an item into their cart. 

## Search Functionality:
A common situation customers might find themselves in is accidently incorrectly spelling an item they are looking for. In order to create a test case for this scenario, I followed these steps:
1. Access the ebay website
2. Search for a specific item by incorrectly spelling it
3. Wait for it to appear
4. Click on an option

## Add-to-cart functionality:
In order to create test cases with different inputs for the add-to-cart functionality, I thought of when customers may try to add something to their cart with specifiying options like size, which consisted of the following steps:
1. Access the ebay website
2. Search for a specific item
3. Wait for it to appear
4. Click on an option
5. Click on the "add-to-cart" button
6. Click on the "cart" button in the top right corner
7. Check cart to see if its empty

Another test case is when customers try to select a size that is not available, which conisists of the following steps:
1. Access the ebay website
2. Search for a specific item
3. Wait for it to appear
4. Click on an option
5. Click on an unavailable size

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

## Maheen:
After using Selenium for the very first time for this assignment, I have found the following advantages and disadvantages. Here are my advantages.

1. Easy to download, use and understand.
2. The steps to create a script are straightforward, and it's simple to record scripts.
3. The idea of using a chrome extension to create and execute web-based tests is attractive.

The following are my disadvantages:

1. Causes my laptop and website to glitch.
2. Everytime you create a new test case, instead of automatically saving the file, it makes you download it everytime.
3. The UI is not the best, sometimes glitches and acts strangely.
4. Using a chrome extension causes chrome to be slower.

Personally, I've never had experience with the alternative testing tool known as "Sikulix", so I cannot guage an opinion on it's testing abilities in compartsion to Selenium.

The PIT part of the lab was quite difficult to get through, as executing mutation tests to a long time on my laptop.
